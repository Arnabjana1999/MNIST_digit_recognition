# MNIST_digit_recognition
Digit recognition task

We perform multi-class classification on handwritten digits. We have used 2 models here- SVM and MLP.

Run:-
1. python3 dig_recog_svc.py (for Support Vector Classifier)
2. python3 dig_recog_mlp.py (for Multi-Layer Perceptron)

On the MNIST test dataset, SVC achieves an accuracy of 97.36% and MLP achieves an accuracy of 94.63%
